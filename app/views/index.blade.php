	<h2>What is this game?</h2>

	<p>Unlike most of the party games you've played before, this one is as 
	despicable and awkward as you and your friends.</p>

	<p>The game is simple; each round, one player asks a question from a black 
	card, and everyone else answers with their funniest white card.</p>

	<!-- <h2>Test Preview Section</h2>

	<p>Once I have time, this will be a simple animation showing how the game 
	works. It will load a random default set of black and white cards to loop 
	through. Every time the page refreshes, it will grab a new random set.</p> -->
